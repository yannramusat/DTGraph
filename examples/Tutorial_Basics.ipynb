    "# Tutorial: An introduction to property graph transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn the key concepts related to our property graph transformations:\n",
    "* How to specify transformations of property graph with this framework (i.e., Understanding how we make use of Skolem functions to construct new property graphs.)\n",
    "* How the rules in a single transformation interact with each other (i.e., How content of output elements can be jointly specified in several rules.)\n",
    "* Understand the notion of *conflicts*, and how to deal with them.\n",
    "* How this framework integrates with openCypher (i.e., How the rules are compiled into openCypher scripts and in which context they are executed.)\n",
    "* What property graph transformations are capable of doing (i.e., The kind of constructs that can be expressed.)\n",
