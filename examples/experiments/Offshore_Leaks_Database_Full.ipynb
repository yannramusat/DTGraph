    "## Experiment 3: Uniformizing intermediaries' address information\n",
    "\n",
    "In this dataset, it may be difficult to find information about the addresses of the $25 745$ intermediaries.  \n",
    "After careful investigation, we found that the registered address of\n",
    "intermediaries can be stored in three different ways in the database:\n",
    "1. `(i:Intermediary)-[:registered_address]->(a:Address)` which concern $10 496$ such intermediaries. In that case, `i.address` is never defined.\n",
    "2. `(i:Intermediary)` where `i.address` is defined and not empty. This concerns $8 643$ such intermediaries.\n",
    "3. `(i:Intermediary)` where `i.address` is defined and empty. This concerns $3 978$ such intermediaries.  \n",
    "  In this case, the following query retrieves the $3 970$ intermediaries where `i.address` is defined and empty and connected to an entity having its address set.  \n",
    "  This is consistent with [the specification of the data](https://offshoreleaks-data.icij.org/offshoreleaks/neo4j/guide/datashape.html) which states that:  \n",
    "  *Each Entity node has the address property only when the address is the same as the one of the intermediary. Otherwise, the registered address information is stored in the address node connected to this Entity node through a REGISTERED_ADDRESS relationship.*\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  MATCH (i:Intermediary)-[:intermediary_of]->(e:Entity) \n",
    "  WHERE i.address IS NOT NULL AND i.address = \"\" \n",
    "  WITH i, collect(DISTINCT e.address) AS e_addresses \n",
    "  WHERE size(e_addresses) > 0\n",
    "  RETURN i, e_addresses\n",
    "  ```  \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence using rules we can uniformize the presentation of address information for the $10 496 + 8643 + 3 970 = 23 109$  intermediaries for which an address is known (out of $25 745$ intermediaries)."
